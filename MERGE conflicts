git branch 
main
git add. 
git commit -m " add new chnage"

git checkout feature1 

git add. 
git commit "add new changes 2"

git diff main 

git merge main  ( currently we are in feature1 branch )

Conflict arised ( when git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits ) as which change need to be added 

 Accept Current chmages | Accept incoming change | Accept both changes  ( click on any options)


git add.
git commit "add both changes" 

git diff
git diff main 
(we have a change )

git checkout main 

Now if we want to add changes of feature1 branch changes to main branch

git merge feature1

(here we didnot get merge conflict because changes are in same lines)


git push
