Back to previous stage 

git reset <file_name>

git reset (reset more changes simultaneously)

git status 
now stage the modified changes and add


If we delete any changes 

* Commited changes ( for one commit) 
git reset HEAD~1   ( To undo one commit)

* git log 


* to undo multiple commits
copy hash of that commit where we want to undo

git reset <copied_hash_ from log)

git reset --hard <hash>  ( orgin commit)
